          "p": "One of Sri Lanka's must-see locations is Yala National Park, sometimes called Ruhuna National Park. This outstanding game reserve, which is the most \r\n well-known in Sri Lanka, is situated in the southeast of the country for good reason. Yala is split into five blocks and has an area of 1,260 \r\n square kilometres. It is said to have the highest density of leopards per square kilometre in the world. The most popular area of the reserve is Block I, which \r\n also offers the best opportunities for a leopard safari. Although leopards are normally difficult to spot, sightings in Yala are very good; you may see them lounging \r\n in the sun on rocky outcrops, in trees, across paths, and next to waterholes. Sloth bears, Asian elephants, deer, monkeys, buffalo, and several bird species coexist \r\n with leopards. Yala provides the finest chance to observe leopards in Sri Lanka if that's your top priority.Yala is one of the earliest national parks in Sri Lanka. \r\n It was first recognised as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, but it wasn't until 1938 that it was made into a national park. The Buddhist temple Sithulpawa, located \r\n in the centre of Yala, was formerly a monastery and is said to have been there for 2,000 years. The monastery is said to have supported 12,000 people at one point \r\n in time, and pilgrims from all around Sri Lanka still come to see it as a significant temple. Nearby are two more important cultural sites: Kataragama and Magul Maha Vihara."

          "p": "Yala is mostly covered with monsoon woods and scrubby shrub because it is situated in the island's dry zone. The reserve is primarily level, but it is \r\n broken up by large granite outcrops, meadows, and brackish lakes. Sand dunes define the reserve's coastline edge. The park receives rainfall \r\n from the northeast monsoon and is located in the island's semi-arid zone."

          "p": "Yala National Park is a year-round wildlife safari attraction. The best times to go are in early October, when the beginning of the drought and the \r\n regrowth of vegetation enhance the chances of seeing animals, and from May to September, when it is dry. Rainfall is brought in by the northeast \r\n monsoon from October/November through January, when the reserve becomes considerably more verdant. The best time to see sloth bears is between May and July when \r\n they are in season and love to gorge on the delicious fruits of the palu tree. Be ready to get up early because early morning and evening are the ideal times to see animals."
