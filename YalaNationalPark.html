            <h2>Yala National Park</h2><br>
            <p>One of Sri Lanka's must-see locations is Yala National Park, sometimes called Ruhuna National Park. This outstanding game reserve, which is the most 
                well-known in Sri Lanka, is situated in the southeast of the country for good reason. Yala is split into five blocks and has an area of 1,260 square 
                kilometres. It is said to have the highest density of leopards per square kilometre in the world. The most popular area of the reserve is Block I,
                 which also offers the best opportunities for a leopard safari. Although leopards are normally difficult to spot, sightings in Yala are very good; 
                 you may see them lounging in the sun on rocky outcrops, in trees, across paths, and next to waterholes. Sloth bears, Asian elephants, deer, monkeys, 
                 buffalo, and several bird species coexist with leopards. Yala provides the finest chance to observe leopards in Sri Lanka if that's your top priority.
                 Yala is one of the earliest national parks in Sri Lanka. It was first recognised as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900, but it wasn't until 1938 that it was
                  made into a national park. The Buddhist temple Sithulpawa, located in the centre of Yala, was formerly a monastery and is said to have been there for 
                  2,000 years. The monastery is said to have supported 12,000 people at one point in time, and pilgrims from all around Sri Lanka still come to see it
                   as a significant temple. Nearby are two more important cultural sites: Kataragama and Magul Maha Vihara.</p>

            <h2>Topography of Yala National Park</h2><br>
            <p>Yala is mostly covered with monsoon woods and scrubby shrub because it is situated in the island's dry zone. The reserve is primarily level, but it is
                 broken up by large granite outcrops, meadows, and brackish lakes. Sand dunes define the reserve's coastline edge. The park receives rainfall from
                  the northeast monsoon and is located in the island's semi-arid zone.</p>

            <h2>Game Drives In Yala National Park</h2><br>
            <p>Yala National Park is a year-round wildlife safari attraction. The best times to go are in early October, when the beginning of the drought and the 
                regrowth of vegetation enhance the chances of seeing animals, and from May to September, when it is dry. Rainfall is brought in by the northeast monsoon
                 from October/November through January, when the reserve becomes considerably more verdant. The best time to see sloth bears is between May and July
                  when they are in season and love to gorge on the delicious fruits of the palu tree. Be ready to get up early because early morning and evening are 
                  the ideal times to see animals.</p>
