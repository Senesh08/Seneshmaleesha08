            <h2>Sri Lankan Junglefowl</h2><br>
            <p>The Ceylon junglefowl, often called Lafayette's junglefowl or the Sri Lankan junglefowl, is an indigenous bird species found 
                only in Sri Lanka. It is closely related to the more well-known red junglefowl and serves as the nation's national bird.It is typical to see this bird 
                in scrub and wooded environments. It may be seen at Yala, Sinharaja, and Kitulgala with ease. It can survive at elevations of up to 2,000 metres 
                (6,500 feet) above sea level.</p>

            <h2>Mugger Crocodile</h2><br>
            <p>The second-largest reptile in Sri Lanka is the mugger crocodile. Known by several names such as the mugger or marsh crocodile, this medium-sized crocodilian
                 species is indigenous to freshwater environments ranging from southern Iran to the Indian subcontinent and Sri Lanka.This crocodile, which can swim 
                 rather well, is found in lakes, rivers, marshes, and man-made ponds. Since 1982, their disappearance has been attributed to a number of factors,
                  including habitat loss, entrapment in fishing nets, traffic accidents, and confrontation with people.

            <h2>Purple-Faced Langur</h2><br>
            <p>The purple-faced leaf monkey, or purple-faced langur, is an Old World monkey species that is unique to Sri Lanka. It has a very long tail that it uses 
                for balance. It is only arboreal.Its population has drastically decreased due to fast urban growth, despite the fact that it was once numerous in
                 the country's wet zones and the areas around Colombo. This monkey is referred to as the "Sri Lanka black monkey" locally.</p>

            <h2>Red Slender Loris</h2><br>
            <p>An indigenous tiny primate species of Sri Lanka is the red slender loris. It lives in lowland rainforests at elevations of up to 700 metres 
                (2,300 feet) and is nocturnal. Masmullah Proposed Forest Reserve is home to one of the last populations of red slender loris.There is very 
                little information available about this primate, including its population size. This species would rank among the top 5 most vulnerable 
                primates on the globe if the reported population of just 100 animals is accurate.</p>

            <h2>Sri Lankan Sloth Bear</h2><br>
            <p>Another big animal found in the nation is the Sri Lankan sloth bear, which coexists with the Sri Lankan leopard for the most part of its habitat.
                 It is an omnivore bear that lives in lowland dry woods and eats flesh and carrion in addition to berries, roots, and nuts.With less than 1,000 
                 specimens remaining (and a wild population of roughly 500), this bear is very vulnerable. The primary causes of that include habitat degradation
                  (this bear heavily depends on natural forests for food supplies), persecution following livestock losses, property damage, and assaults on people.
                   It is therefore feared in Sri Lanka.</p>
