It may be seen at Yala, Sinharaja, and Kitulgala with ease. It can survive at elevations of up to 2,000 metres \r\n (6,500 feet) above sea level."

Since 1982, their disappearance has been attributed to a number of factors,\r\n including habitat loss, entrapment in fishing nets, traffic accidents, and confrontation with people."
