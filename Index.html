            <h2>Introduction of Srilankan Wildlife</h2><br>
            <p>Sri Lanka, like many other islands, is home to a large number of endemic species, or animals and plants that are unique to our planet. 
                The sheer number of species that call the Tear Drop Isle home has led to the nation being recognised as one of the top five biodiversity 
                hotspots in the world..The island of Sri Lanka is home to a diverse array of wildlife, including elephants, leopards, marine life, and a
                 wide variety of birds. It is also one of the greatest sites in the world to witness whales, notably the majestic blue whale. A taste of
                  Sri Lankan wildlife is simple to come by, since 12% of the nation is set aside for wildlife conservation. The best places to observe 
                  animals in their natural environment are safari parks and sanctuaries, especially in the southern and central regions. Watch out for
                   sightings of the endangered leopard; stroll calmly along the west and south coast beaches; or take your time observing the elephants as
                    they graze and bathe in a tank or lagoon.

            <h2>Diverse Ecosystems Sri Lanka</h2><br>
            <p>Sri Lanka exhibits a wide array of ecosystems, ranging from forest to agricultural, aquatic and marine environments. The several climatic 
                zones that exist in the country are characterized by specific forest types, including rainforests, mountain cloud forests, dry zone monsoon
                 forests and arid thorn scrub forests. With 1,620 km of coastline, rich marine and coastal biodiversity is also represented, notably including
                  208 species of hard coral and 756 species of marine molluscs<br><br>
                The island has a diverse range of ecosystems. Inland wetlands, forests,grasslands, and coastal and marine habitats are
                 the main types of natural ecosystems found in the nation. Agricultural environments are included as well.There are many 
                 kinds of forests: dry mixed evergreen forests, dry thorn forests, and wet evergreen forests (both lowland and montane). 
                 Low country and the montane areas are home to grasslands. A complicated system of rivers and freshwater bodies is a part of inland wetlands.
