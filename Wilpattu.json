This is Sri Lanka's largest and oldest wildlife \r\n reserve, taking up a wide tract of territory that borders the ancient ruins of the Cultural Triangle, the Northern Province, and the copper-sand beaches \r\n of the country's west coast. The park supports an amazing bird life, Asian Elephants, Sri Lankan Leopards, and Sri Lankan Sloth Bears, among many other indigenous \r\n species.Although Wilpattu was originally established in 1905 as a wildlife refuge, this 13,500-hectare park did not get national park status until February 1938."

          "p": "'Willu' and 'pattu' broadly translate as the Land of the Lakes, and this is exactly what defines this beautiful reserve. In among the lowland forest, \r\n open scrubland and thick jungle lie up to 60 'villus' - natural, shallow rainwater-collecting basins, which expand and contract with the seasons. \r\n Wildlife is drawn to these pristine waterholes and the lush grassy banks that surround them, which makes them prime spots for wildlife spotting throughout the year."

          "p": "Wilpattu National Park is home to Sri Lanka's most exciting, longed-to-see wildlife. These include the elusive Sri Lankan leopard, the Asian Elephant \r\n and the Sri Lankan Sloth Bear alongside a supporting cast of spotted and sambar deer, crocodiles, mongooses and water buffalo. Leopard sightings are \r\n amongst the best in the country despite the reserve having a much less dense leopard population than Yala National Park.The aquatic features of the park also make \r\n this one of Sri Lanka's best places for bird watching - some of the endemics include the Ceylon grey hornbill, the Ceylon Prakeet and the Red-backed woodpecker. \r\n You may also spy the brownish chicken-like Sri Lankan Jungle fowl, Sri Lanka's national bird."
